# nvim-claude Debug Tasks

## âœ… All Issues Resolved!

## Completed Tasks

- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Baseline stash management - Now properly handles per-file baselines and new files
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: `<leader>ci` refresh - Now immediately shows newly edited files  
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Ghost diff at end of files - Fixed newline inconsistencies causing phantom hunks

## Summary

All major debugging tasks have been completed. The nvim-claude plugin now has:

1. **Robust per-file baseline management** - Accurately tracks changes without showing developer edits as Claude changes
2. **Immediate UI updates** - `<leader>ci` shows newly edited files right away
3. **Clean diff display** - No more phantom hunks from newline inconsistencies

The plugin is working as intended! ðŸŽ‰
